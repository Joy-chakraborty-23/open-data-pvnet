Test Suite Improvements for Open Data PVnet

This document outlines the key enhancements made to the existing test suite in tests/test_utils.py, focusing on reliability, determinism, and maintainability while preserving original functionality.



#1. Environment Loader Tests

Original Issue:
 Relied on patching modulelevel constants and did not verify that environment variables were actually populated.
 No isolation: existing environment variables could interfere with tests.

Improvements:
1. Isolation with monkeypatch:
    Use monkeypatch.delenv to ensure tested variables are unset before loading.
    Set PROJECT_BASE via monkeypatch.setenv rather than patching the module constant, simulating real environment behavior.
2. Explicit Assertions:
    After loading, assert that each variable appears in os.environ with the expected value.
3. Error Handling Verification:
    Confirm a missing .env file raises FileNotFoundError with a clear message.

python
def test_load_environment_variables_success(monkeypatch, tmp_path):
    Prepare .env file
    env_file = tmp_path / ".env"
    env_file.write_text("TEST_VAR=test_value\nANOTHER_VAR=123")

    Isolate environment
    monkeypatch.delenv("TEST_VAR", raising=False)
    monkeypatch.delenv("ANOTHER_VAR", raising=False)
    monkeypatch.setenv("PROJECT_BASE", str(tmp_path))

    load_environment_variables()

    assert os.getenv("TEST_VAR") == "test_value"
    assert os.getenv("ANOTHER_VAR") == "123"




#2. Version Format Test (Dynamic File Discovery)

 Note: If present in the test suite, the following update was applied to locate the pyproject.toml file relative to the test file instead of assuming the current working directory.

diff
def test_version_format():
    with open("pyproject.toml") as f:
        content = f.read()
+def test_version_format():
+    from pathlib import Path
+    project_root = Path(__file__).parents[1]
+    pyproject_path = project_root / "pyproject.toml"
+    content = pyproject_path.read_text()


Benefit: Tests are robust to workingdirectory changes during CI or local runs.



#3. CLI Output Assertions

 Applicable to tests/test_cli.py.

Original Approach:
 Checked the number of print calls, which could pass even if text was wrong.

Improved Approach:
 Capture stdout with capsys and assert that expected provider names are present.

python
def test_main_list_providers(capsys):
    run_cli(["listproviders"])
    out = capsys.readouterr().out
    assert "Available providers:" in out
    for provider in ("metoffice", "gfs", "dwd"):
        assert provider in out




#4. General Best Practices

 Use of Fixtures: Codelevel fixtures (temp_dirs, sample_nc_file, etc.) ensure consistent test data creation and cleanup.
 Mocking External Dependencies: All network calls (HTTP, S3, Hugging Face, Zarr stores) are stubbed with unittest.mock.patch to keep tests fast and offline.
 Parametrization & Organization: Future splits of large test files and use of pytest.mark.parametrize are recommended to reduce duplication.
 Coverage Tracking: A pytestcov integration is encouraged to identify untested branches or errorhandling code paths.



By adopting these changes, the test suite achieves:
 Determinism: No reliance on external state or CWD
 Clarity: Tests verify both side effects and content
 Maintainability: Easier to extend and refactor with confidence
