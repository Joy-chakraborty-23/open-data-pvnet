# 🌞 Open Source Solar Forecasting Project – Volunteers Welcome! 🌞

## Scope

We're building an open-source solar forecasting pipeline to integrate with the OCF's [PVNet](https://github.com/openclimatefix/pvnet) using publicly available data to predict solar generation at the national level, starting with the UK. Eventually, we aim to achieve **global coverage**! 🌍

Tasks include:
- Identifying gridded Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) datasets.
- Downloading and transforming NWP data into the preferred Zarr format.
- Acquiring solar generation target data via APIs (e.g., PVlive's solar generation and capacity API).
- Creating pipelines for batching data and ML model experimentation.
- Deploying the model to the cloud.

We will begin in the UK to benchmark against OCF results and expand to other countries as the project progresses. 😄
