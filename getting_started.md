## Introduction to Solar Forecasting
Solar forecasting is the process of predicting the amount of solar energy that will be generated over a specific period. Understanding this helps optimize renewable energy systems and integrate them with the grid.

## What is NWP Data?
**Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)** data uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to forecast weather. It predicts various atmospheric conditions such as temperature, pressure, wind speed, humidity, precipitation type and amount, cloud cover, and sometimes even surface conditions and air qualityâ€”all of which are crucial for solar forecasting.

## Understanding Zarr Format

**zarr** is a relatively new, cloud-based data format designed to improve access to N-dimensional arrays. It provides an effective way to store large N-dimensional data in the cloud, with access facilitated through predefined chunks. Zarr can be viewed as the cloud-based counterpart to HDF5/NetCDF files, as it follows a similar data model. However, unlike NetCDF or HDF5, which store data in a single file, Zarr organizes data as a directory containing compressed binary files for chunks of data, alongside metadata stored in external JSON files.

The semantic mapping from the NetCDF Data Model to the Zarr Data Model is as follows:

| NetCDF Data Model | Zarr V2 Data Model                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| File              | Store                             |
| Group             | Group                             |
| Variable          | Array                             |
| Attribute         | User Attribute                    |
| Dimension         | Not supported as a native feature |

A Zarr array can be stored in any storage system that supports a key/value interface. In this system:

A key is an ASCII string.
A value is an arbitrary sequence of bytes.
Supported operations include:
Read: Retrieve the sequence of bytes associated with a key.
Write: Set the sequence of bytes associated with a key.
Delete: Remove a key/value pair.
Currently, Zarr V2 is the stable version, while Zarr V3 is considered experimental.
